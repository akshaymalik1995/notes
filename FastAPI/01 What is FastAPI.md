# What is FastAPI?
- Like any web framework, FastAPI helps you build web applications.
- Every framework is designed to make some operations easierâ€”by features, omissions, and defaults.
- As the name implies, FastAPI targets development of web APIs, although you can use it for traditional web content applications as well

**The FastAPI website claims these advantages:**
-  **Performance**: As fast as Node.js and Go in some cases, unusual for Python frameworks
-  **Faster development**: No sharp edges or oddities.
- **Better code quality**: Type hinting and models help reduce bugs.
-  **Autogenerated documentation and test pages**:  Much easier than hand-editing OpenAPI descriptions.

**FastAPI uses the following:**
- Python type hints
- Starlette for the web machinery, including async support
- Pydantic for data definitions and validation
- Special integration to leverage and extend the others

 This combination makes a pleasing development environment for web applications,
 especially RESTful web services.
